# ⚡ ThunderDate  
**A sleek, Norse-themed sign-up form built as part of The Odin Project’s _Intermediate HTML & CSS_ course.**

## 🧠 Overview  
ThunderDate is a responsive (desktop-first) mock sign-up page for an imaginary dating service for gods, mortals, and everyone in between.  
This project focuses on semantic HTML structure, accessible form design, and custom CSS styling — with an emphasis on clean, professional UI.

## 🛠️ Built With  
- **HTML5** – semantic structure and form validation  
- **CSS3** – Flexbox layout, custom properties, pseudo-classes, and validation styling  
- **Google Fonts & Local Fonts** – Norse and Cinzel typefaces  
- **Accessibility features** – focus states, color contrast, labeled form elements, and ARIA-friendly grouping  

## 🧩 Key Features  
- Custom form with grouped sections (personal info, weapon choice, password)  
- HTML5 validation (`required`, `pattern`, and `title` attributes)  
- Accessible radio button group with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`  
- Dynamic input feedback using `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo-classes  
- Branded design with lightning-themed hero image and purple-gold palette  

## 💡 Lessons Learned  
- Structuring forms semantically for accessibility  
- Using pseudo-classes for real-time validation feedback  
- Understanding Flexbox behavior across containers  
- Applying box shadows and hover/focus transitions cleanly  
- Maintaining clean, readable CSS with comments and custom variables  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Implement full responsive layout (mobile-first workflow)  
- Add JavaScript password match validation  
- Enhance accessibility with live ARIA error messages
